## Concept

An FTP server is a computer which has a file transfer protocol (FTP) address and is dedicated to receiving an FTP connection.

An FTP server needs a TCP/IP network for functioning and is dependent on usage of dedicated servers with one or more FTP clients. In order to ensure that connections can be established at all times from the clients, an FTP server is usually switched on.

We have implemented the server using Python sockets library, The Server hosts many files which can be requested for download by multiple Clients.
